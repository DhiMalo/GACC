## Sub-Heading ##
  > Bringing together the programming community, beginners welcome.
  
## Summary ##
  > GACC connects you with the programming community, seamlessly and in a userfriendly way. It integrates easily with Codeshare.io. Or you can chat live with an expert.  The sky is the limit, even for beginners. 

## Problem ##
  > GitHub is a community of members.  But don't you ever wonder: Where is everybody?  It takes days to have a full conversation on IRC, depending on who is logged on or leaving their server logged in on their behalf. With Stack Overflow and Slack, we often wait days for a response.

## Solution ##
  > GACC brings the community to you, with an always-up, live link to other programmers around the globe.  Moving your IRC chat channel to GACC means unanswered questions can get attention from millions of programmers in the GitHub community, and fast!  
  > And don't worry if you're new to all this.  If you're new to the programming community, we throw out the red carpet.  Be our guest and browse what others are up to, then we'll link you up to establish your own GitHub account so you can start collaborating.
